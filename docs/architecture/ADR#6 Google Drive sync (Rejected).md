# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) #6: Realm DB sync ðŸ”´

Drop Ivy Cloud and any custom backend in favor of user managed backup/sync system using Google Drive.

Bold Bet: store data using [Realm Mobile Db](https://realm.io/) and simply export/importing `.realm` DB file to and from Google Drive.

The best thing about `.realm` is that it has cross-platform support and it'll work on Web and iOS, too.

# Conclusion
Realm DB won't be used because it's paid and we'll lose the benefits of Room DB. We'll use JSON backups + Google Drive sync.
